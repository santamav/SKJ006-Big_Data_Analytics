Why did ChatGPT+DallE become so much worse in creating Pixel Art?,"About three weeks ago I've noticed an immense dip in quality regarding Pixel Art.

I've created a ton of art-work for a (free) videogame and it was amazing how well ChatGPT and DallE ""understood"" what I wanted.

Did I accidentally automate myself out of the job?," I turned a vague app idea into a fully functional software - no humans involved in the process, all thanks to ChatGPT Assistants. This wasn't coding; it was orchestrating AI to bring a concept to life. Here's the breakdown:

Step 1: From Idea to Project Plan  
I kicked off with an assistant that took a basic app concept and fleshed it out into a full project description. Think data structures, storage, UI design, scalability, and performance. It's like going from a sketch to a detailed architectural plan.

Step 2: Blueprint to Tasks  
Next, another assistant dissected this plan into a list of clear, actionable tasks. It's the stage where a grand plan gets sliced into bite-sized, doable chunks.

Step 3: From Tasks to Code  
The final step was the real game-changer. The third assistant took these tasks and turned them into actual code, including a feedback loop for error handling and troubleshooting. This wasn't just automation; it was AI adapting and problem-solving on the fly.

The Trial Run: CD Library Console App  
For my test, I built a CD library console application. Sure, I had to manually interact with the assistants and fix a few errors along the way, but the end product was a fully functional executable, all zipped up and ready to go. This proved that the whole ""idea to executable"" process isn't just a pipe dream – it's real and it works!

Just a few hours, one person, and we have a working app. It shows how AI can massively streamline software development.

Choose context summarization instead of cosine similarity on embedding as dynamic context management strategy,"This question came to me as I learned to develop a chat agent which lives in the command-line interface.I had a moment when I asked GPT to summarize our past conversation and hold the rest of the conversation with the summarized context only. But I believe that just inform GPT to set priority rather than removing the past conversation from the conversation stack.

Back to the topic, I choose text-based context summarization instead of cosine similarity on embedding as a dynamic context management strategy. Below is what I find/believe and I am eager to hear from everyone. I strongly believe that having a suitable context management strategy is one of the keys to a successful AI agent.

# cosine similarity

*Pros*

* Precisely pick up the relevant context
* Less bound to noise/side-track topic

*Cons*

* Require greater computation resources on the local end
* Each round of message are treated independently, thus compromising the sequential characteristic of chats
* Less intuitive to the user

# text-based context summarization

*Pros*

* Can be dispatched to LLM
* Adaptive summarization, takes the entire conversation into account
* Summarization recipe can be configured in natural language

*Cons*

* Cost, basically passing the entire conversations to LLM
* Depend heavily on LLM to do the job well

&#x200B;

**Other Method**

* dynamic context window (First In First Out)
* context summarization with relevance (tag each conversation with cosine similarity to the current command/request)

Effective Altruism for the Curious,"
## What is Effective Altruism?

Effective Altruism (EA) is a philosophical and social movement that aims to answer a simple question, but one that's hard to answer: **How can we use our resources to help others the most?**

EA claims to combine empathy with empirical reasoning, focusing on evidence and rigorous analysis to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.

However, such claims are difficult to quantify, as when judging effectiveness, EA proponents argue for employing a consequentialist ethical view.  As the saying goes: **""The road to hell is lined with good intentions""**

This may mean that they may believe that as long as the final result is good, the road to get there was good.  Or if the final result was bad, the road to get there was bad.  However, it appears that the EA view is to apply ethical reasoning along each step of the process.

I'll try to be as level handed as I can. I'm not exactly a follower of EA philosophy; but I am of the belief that it's currently getting a bad rap for things that don't have much to do with its philosophy itself, but more with individual interpretations of that philosophy.

## Core Principles of Effective Altruism

1. **Empirical Evidence**: EA emphasizes using scientific evidence and careful reasoning to determine the most effective ways to improve lives.

2. **Rational Decision-Making**: Decisions about where to allocate resources are made based on data and effectiveness, rather than personal biases or emotional appeals.

3. **Scope and Scale**: EA considers the scale of an issue, seeking solutions that can have a large-scale impact.

4. **Neglectedness**: It often focuses on areas that are neglected but have the potential for high impact.

5. **Tractability**: The likelihood of an intervention making a significant impact is a key consideration.

## Key Focus Areas

- **Global Health and Development**: Finding and funding interventions that can significantly improve health and economic outcomes in developing countries.
  
- **Animal Welfare**: Advocating for and implementing strategies to reduce animal suffering, particularly in industrial farming.

- **Long-Term Future**: Addressing risks that could affect humanity's long-term future, like artificial intelligence safety and pandemic prevention.

- **An Important Note**:  As with all philosophy, this is just the scope of the areas they wish to discuss.  There's a wide ranging array of views in regards to each of these areas and what best fulfils the aims EA.  For instance, a group wanting to hamstring AI and a group that wants full featured AI can simultaneously exist under the EA umbrella.

## Further Reading

- **They got a damn textbook**: You can learn more about the principles and research of EA through resources like [the effective altruist handbook](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/handbook)

No, seriously, read it.  It's friggin' huge.  What I'm saying here are just the basics, if you truly want to understand EA, this post won't suffice.

## Criticisms

- **Oversimplification of Complex Problems**:  One critique is the argument that EA's emphasis on quantifiable impact can oversimplify complex social and ethical issues.


- **Prioritization of Causes**: EA's focus on certain causes over others can be a bit disagreeable, as it may overlook important but less measurable areas of need.


- **Utilitarian Leanings**: EA is often associated with utilitarian ethics, which prioritize actions that maximize overall happiness or well-being. This can lead to ethical dilemmas, where the well-being of a few might be sacrificed for the greater good.  There are a number of logical errors in most utilitarian applications.  Namely, when the nature of an action does benefit a larger number of people, but there still seems to be an objection based on some other ground.  An example of such a thing would be: **two consenting adult siblings of the same sex engage in an incestuous relationship**.  In a utilitarian sense, this would be completely acceptable, however, I believe one would be hard pressed to find a utilitarian with such a view.  When it comes to ethics, applying philosophy is tricky and usually not strictly adhered to.  It's more that people have emotional judgements for things and then use philosophy to rationalize these judgements as opposed to actually holding a philosophical viewpoint.


- **Actions of Prominent Figures**: The behavior of individuals who claim to adhere to EA principles, such as Sam Bankman-Fried, has drawn criticism. Actions that are perceived as unethical or contradictory to EA principles have led to debates about the movement's integrity and the application of its values in real-world scenarios.  I would argue that in any movement and *especially* in a philosophical movement, many people will not be on the same page.  People will have different ideas on what the ethical course of action will be.  For instance, in Stoicism, some believe that it was virtuous to be celibate as any action in service of lust was seen as hedonistic in nature.  Other philosophers believed that pursuing and enjoying love and connection, to include sex was a virtuous endeavor, in line with the pursuing **eudaimonia**, human flourishing. Drastically different views, however both are valid applications of the underlying principles. It is not enough to look at the results of a philosophy to come to a judgement about it.  Instead look at the philosophy itself and judge the actions in relation to how well they adhere to the concepts presented.

*This post was just meant to be something like a 101 on Effective Altruism, since there seems to be an interest in it on this sub in relation to events that have transpired recently.  It wasn't meant to have my own personal views, though in explaining some examples, I did allow some bias to slip through in service of providing the logical argument that I believe makes the most sense.*

*I'm not an Effective Altruist, as I primarily believe that philosophy should serve as a foundation to build up your world view, not as your world view itself.  Philosophy has historically been lacking in its ability to address real world problems in a broad way.*

*EA seeks to remedy this, however, I'm skeptical of its ability to do so.  The human propensity to act against nature (nature is philosophically defined in stoicism\* as ""the best version of a species/thing"") leads me to believe that, while admirable, it is ultimately doomed to be ineffective.*

Will you find an open-source agent playground like this useful?,"Hey /r/OpenAI ,

I know we've been seeing a lot of wrapper AI apps around here lately, but I wanted to throw my hat in the ring too! I've been working on designing these AI agents (remember AutoGPT anyone?) and then I realized that I would love to have a place where it's simple to spin agents up, and talk to them simultaneously. Couldn't find one, so I decided to build it myself. Here is the preview video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaaU81niOpw 

So the only unique feature of the app for now includes:
- Parallel conversations with multiple agents. Yes, I know, it's essentially a basic UI for the API, but this will pave the way for some exciting features down the line.

What I'm working on (as fast as I can):
- a plugin system to enhance the agents' capabilities (features like rendering HTML or enabling cross-thread functionality, etc.)
- a multi-agents chat system

It's definitely a work in progress, but I'm proud of how it's shaping. I hope mine brings some fresh ideas to the table, too. Stay tuned for some exciting updates coming soon!

The code is here: https://github.com/trungtin/agentround and the app itself: https://agentround.com/

DevDay API rant and issues,"So it's definitely cool to have access to all these new features, but there's so many problems with them. Like for those of you that use GPT-4V, this is always declining at random, totally normal images for no reason whatsoever. It's completely unstable. And then for those that use the API, well, then you can only use the API for GPT-4V using Turbo. So it's not actually as accurate as the one on OpenAI, so it's not good for developers. They've given us a lesser version. Secondly, the Assistance API is completely unstable, commonly rejecting the same file formats. Completely normal, benign, easy CSV files are rejected. Really, they're great tools, but they're not ready for primetime, and OpenAI needs to take it seriously, because nobody wants to build on such unstable platforms.",27-11-2023 22:23:28,2,"[{'body': 'If Google comes out with Gemini and it’s the same thing but it’s actually works every time and is stable. It would be highly superior for those of us that are building in the developer community.', 'timestamp': '27-11-2023 22:24:23'}]",,
